## Basic Usage

To run a prediction:

    cog predict -i prompt="Write a short email to Sam Altman giving reasons to open source GPT-5"

Output

    Dear Sam, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today to express my concern about the recent decision to keep the GPT-5 model closed source. As you may know, GPT-5 is a powerful natural language processing model that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. However, by keeping it closed source, you are limiting its potential impact on society. One of the key benefits of open source software is that it allows for greater collaboration and innovation. By opening up GPT-5, you would be allowing researchers and developers from around the world to contribute to its development and improve its capabilities. This could lead to new applications and use cases that we cannot even imagine today. Additionally, open sourcing GPT-5 would help to address concerns about the potential misuse of the technology. By making the code public, it would be easier to monitor and regulate its use, ensuring that it is not being used for nefarious purposes. In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider your decision to keep GPT-5 closed source. By opening it up, you would be unlocking its true potential and ensuring that it benefits
